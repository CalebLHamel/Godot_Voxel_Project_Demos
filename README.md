# Godot_Voxel_Project_Demos
Access to demos (videos and screenshots) showing-off what my Godot Voxel Project can do.

This project of mine is still very-much a work in progress and I'd rather the code for it not be publicly available, since as far I've seen online, I'm one of few people to have done something like this. Instead, I've left a link to a google-drive folder with some videos and screenshots showing the program running. I would be happy to demonstrate the project in person if the opportunity arises. Note that you may have to sign to google to see that I am the owner of these files.
